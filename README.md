# AMD Prediction Using Retinal Fundus Images

This project uses deep learning to predict **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** from retinal fundus images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a binary classification task to distinguish between AMD-affected and normal eyes.

## About Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

**Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** is a progressive eye condition that affects the **macula**, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. It is a **leading cause of vision loss in adults over 50** and can significantly impact quality of life by making it difficult to read, drive, recognize faces, or perform tasks requiring fine vision.

### Types of AMD

1. **Dry AMD (Atrophic):**
   - Most common form (~85â€“90% of cases)
   - Caused by thinning of macular tissue over time
   - Slower progression but currently no cure

2. **Wet AMD (Neovascular or Exudative):**
   - Less common but more severe
   - Caused by abnormal blood vessels under the retina
   - Leads to rapid vision loss but is treatable with anti-VEGF injections

### Risk Factors
- Age (50+)
- Family history
- Smoking
- High blood pressure
- Obesity
- Sunlight exposure

### Symptoms
- Blurred or distorted vision
- Straight lines appear wavy (metamorphopsia)
- Difficulty recognizing faces
- Dark or empty areas in central vision

### Importance of Early Detection

Early detection of AMD is crucial for preventing severe vision loss. Regular retinal screenings help monitor disease progression. AI-powered tools like this project aim to **automate AMD detection from retinal images**, making diagnosis **faster, cheaper, and scalable**, especially in resource-limited settings.
